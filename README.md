At a high level there are many exciting opportunities for AI. However, the zeitgeist for the future
of AI is to bring the cost of intelligence down to 0. There are some clear indications that this
technology will impact what knowledge is, how we store and exchange it, how we apply
knowledge, and what core ideas of knowledge should we focus on in our society. In this work,
we seek to solve the meta-problem that is still present, which is, knowledge exposure and
retention by leveraging existing AI methods. Knowledge exposure and retention involve
neurobiological, and psychobiological mechanisms related to attention, and memory. "The
Impact of Artificial Intelligence: Widespread Job Losses" by Haseeb Ahmad Ayazi (2020)
highlights the potential of AI to improve the educational system by automating repetitive tasks,
personalizing learning experiences, and providing feedback to students in real-time. The
"Artificial Intelligence in Education: Promises and Implications for Teaching and Learning" by
Sharon L. Comstock and Amy M. Johnson (2020) examines the potential of AI to revolutionize
the way we approach education. It discusses how AI can be used to personalize learning
experiences, identify learning gaps, and provide feedback to students. "How AI can help
students to study better?" by Jaspreet Kaur and Rishu Saini (2020) explores the various ways in
which AI can be leveraged to improve student learning outcomes. It discusses the potential of AI
to provide personalized learning experiences, assess student progress, and improve teacher
effectiveness. "Effective study habits" by The Learning Center at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill offers practical advice on how students can develop effective study
habits. It suggests strategies such as creating a study schedule, setting realistic goals, and
minimizing distractions.From these sources, we can see that AI has the potential to
revolutionize the educational system by personalizing learning experiences, and providing
real-time feedback. However, none of them place an emphasis on the user experience, and the
importance of effective study habits in student learning outcomes. Meta-Learning strategies
such as creating an information absorption routine, pre-topic exposure, and attention for
retention, is critical for learning effectively, but difficult to achieve conveniently. The problem
being addressed in this project is to develop a voice-enabled conversational agent, which can
understand natural language queries, respond accurately, and provide audio output. The
challenge is to design a system that can be easily accessible on mobile devices and should be
able to carry out relevant information with the user as if they were talking to another person.
This will enable users to interact, hands-free, and will provide a more immersive user
experience. To develop the voice-based conversational agent, several methods can be
explored, such as natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, text-to-speech (TTS),
and deep learning techniques. The NLP algorithms can be used to parse and understand the
user's input, while speech recognition algorithms can be used to convert the user's voice to text.
The General Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) API can be used to generate appropriate
responses to the user's input, and TTS can be used to convert these responses into audible
format. One approach we are considering for transcription is OpenAIâ€™s Whisper, Google
Speech-to-Text or Amazon Transcribe. For the text-to-speech some potential avenues include
Google Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, and Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech. To evaluate the
effectiveness of leveraging AI hands-free for learning and overall human-to-computer
interaction, we will use various metrics, including accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction.
To measure accuracy, we will use a dataset of common questions and responses and evaluate
if the AI is providing accurate responses. To measure response time, we will take 3 timestamps,
first to see how long voice transcription takes, second how long it takes for the chatbot to
generate a response after receiving a query, and for how long it takes to convert that into
audible speech to record. These timestamps will be critical for benchmarking which existing
technologies need to be improved for better user experience. Finally, we will conduct user
testing to gather subjective feedback (from a scale of 1-5) on the applications usability,
information retention, knowledge exposure, accessibility, and overall experience.
